## gltext

**Note**: This package is experimental and subject to change.
Use at your own discretion.

The gltext package offers a simple set of text rendering utilities for OpenGL
programs. It deals with TrueType and Bitmap (raster) fonts. Text can be
rendered in various directions (Left-to-right, right-to-left and top-to-bottom).
This allows for correct display of text for various languages.

The package supports the full set of unicode characters, provided the loaded
font does as well.


### TODO

* Have a look at Valve's 'Signed Distance Field` techniques to render
  sharp font textures are different zoom levels.

  * [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGZRHJvJYIg)
  
  More links to info in the youtube video description.
  An alternative might be a port of [GLyphy](http://code.google.com/p/glyphy/)


### Known bugs

* Determining the height of truetype glyphs is not entirely accurate.
  It is unclear at this point how to get to this information reliably.
  Specifically the parts in `LoadTruetype` at truetype.go#L54+.
  The vertical glyph bounds computed by freetype-go are not correct for
  certain fonts. Right now we manually offset the value by added `4` to
  the height. This is an unreliable hack and should be fixed.
* `freetype-go` does not expose `AdvanceHeight` for vertically rendered fonts.
  This may mean that the Advance size for top-to-bottom fonts is incorrect.
